**Purpose:**
The purpose of this study is to investigate how vocal characteristics influence listeners' judgments of a speaker's perceived sexuality.

**Procedures:**
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to:
> Provide basic demographic information, including your age, gender identity, sexual orientation, whether you know someone who is gay in real life, and whether you are a native English speaker.
> Listen to a series of short voice samples.
> Rate each speakerâ€™s perceived sexuality on a 1-5 scale, where 1 = 100% heterosexual/straight, 5 = 100% homosexual/gay, and 3 = evenly bisexual.

**Confidentiality:**
No personally identifying information will be collected. All data will be stored anonymously.
While the dataset may be made publicly available for academic and educational purposes
(e.g., via GitHub), no information will be included that can be used to identify you.

**Risks and Benefits:**
There are no anticipated risks beyond those of everyday online activities. There is no direct benefit to you, but your responses will contribute to research on linguistic perception and social identity.

**Contact:**
